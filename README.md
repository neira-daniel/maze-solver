# Maze Solver

A guided project from [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

## What it does

Creates a maze and solves it automatically following these steps:

1. Creates a new Window using Tkinter
2. Draws a solid maze with closed cells
3. Breaks down some walls in the cells to make the maze playable
4. Runs a depth-first like algorithm to solve the maze showing the user the path the algorithm takes

## How to run it

Execute `/.main.sh`.

## Instructor's suggestions for extending the project

- Add other solving algorithms, like breadth-first search or A*
- Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
- Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
- Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
- Make much larger mazes to solve
- Make it a game where the user chooses directions
- If you made it a game, allow the user to race an algorithm
- Make it 3 dimensional
- Time the various algorithms and see which ones are the fastest
